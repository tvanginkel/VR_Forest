# VR_Forest
My final year project for 'Batchillerato'.
For anyone wondering I got a 100%. 

<h2>Overview</h2>
You decide to go camping to a forest in the middle of nowhere, but it's full of empty cans. And you have OCD.<br>
Find all cans and throw them in the bins scattered around the map before your OCD kills you. You have 3 minutes.  
<br><br>And don't forget to enjoy the views!


<h2>Tecnhologies used:</h2>
-Unreal Engine 4<br/>
-Blender<br/>
-Visual Studio Community 2018<br/>
